# TensorNetworkQuantumSimulator.jl

A Julia package for simulating quantum circuits, quantum dynamics and equilibrium physics with tensor networks of near-arbitrary geometry. Built on top of [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl) and [NamedGraphs.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/NamedGraphs.jl).

## Features

- **Tensor Networks of Arbitrary Geometry**: 2D and 3D lattices (square, hexagonal, heavy-hex, Lieb, cubic), trees, and custom graphs via [NamedGraphs.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/NamedGraphs.jl).
- **Custom Site Types**: Multiple spin and bosonic modes per tensor, with complete flexibility over where physical degrees of freedom live in the network.
- **Gate Application**: Apply large circuits with full control over SVD truncation via the simple update algorithm with BP-computed environments. Fast, simple, and robust. Full update with boundary MPS environments is also supported for planar graphs. Both real-time and imaginary-time evolution are supported.
- **Expectation Values**: Belief propagation, boundary MPS, and exact contraction backends for computing expectation values of multi-point observables.
- **Entanglement Entropy**: Von Neumann and Rényi entropies from BP messages (per bond) or from reduced density matrices (per subsystem).
- **Sampling**: Sample from planar tensor network states using boundary MPS, with the MPS bond dimension controlling sample quality. Options to compute the importance-sampling ratio ``p(x)/q(x)`` for direct sample quality certification.
- **Operators**: Operator evolution in the Heisenberg picture and density matrix representation.
- **GPU Support**: GPU acceleration via CUDA.jl or Metal.jl. CUDA.jl is highly recommended for large bond dimension simulations, where it can provide dramatic speedups.
- **Arbitrary Precision**: `Float32`, `Float64`, `ComplexF32`, `ComplexF64`, and other numeric types.

## Algorithm Overview

| Algorithm | Keyword | Graph Requirement | Cost | Accuracy |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|------|----------|
| Belief propagation | `alg = "bp"` | Any | Low | Exact on trees, approximate on loopy graphs |
| Boundary MPS | `alg = "boundarymps"` | Planar | Variable (scales cubically in `mps_bond_dimension`) | Controllably accurate, converges to exact with increasing MPS bond dimension |
| Loop corrections | `alg = "loopcorrections"` | Any | Moderate | Systematic corrections to BP; accurate when correlations decay exponentially |
| Exact contraction | `alg = "exact"` | Any (small systems only) | Exponential in system size | Exact |

## Installation
